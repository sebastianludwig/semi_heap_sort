Hard time sorting things? Difficulties to decide on an order?


# Demo: Task Tinder

Task Tinder finds a Hamiltonian path in an intransitive set by letting you pick a winner between two options multiple times.

Just check out the [demo](https://rawgit.com/sebastianludwig/semi_heap_sort/master/src/demo.html).


# Implementation

The sorting is done by an implementation of the [semi-heap sort algorighm by Jie Wu](https://github.com/sebastianludwig/semi_heap_sort/blob/master/Wu%20-%20On%20Sorting%20an%20Intransitive%20Total%20Ordered%20Set%20Using%20Semi-Heap.pdf). The repository contains a Ruby and a JavaScript version, both unit tested.


# More resources

There's more than one algorithm to solve this problem. Maybe it's worth trying out another one.
